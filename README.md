# python-challenge
This assignment consisted of using python in VSCode to work with CSV files, perform an analysis, and output a summary analysis in .txt format.  There were 2 datasets, requiring 2 separate codes and 2 output files.

# What each code does (generally)
Both codes open their corresponding CSV, read thru the values and calculate/create any desired values or lists, and then print summaries to both the terminal and a text file

# What the codes calculate
The **PyBank** code currently calculates the following:
    The total number of months included in the dataset
    The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
    The average month-to-month change over the course of the dataset
    The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
    The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


 The **PyPoll** code currently calculates the following:
    The total number of votes cast
    A complete list of candidates who received votes
    The percentage of votes each candidate won
    The total number of votes each candidate won
    The winner of the election based on popular vote.
